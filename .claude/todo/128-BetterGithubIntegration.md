Improve GitHub integration. When I create item then issue is created in Github. When I edit it's content, comment or mark it complete or delete it all goes sync to Github - good!

What is missing:
1. When I delete the comment it won't get deleted from GitHub
2. When someone comments in Github - won't come to board here
3. When someone Commits to Github it won't display in board activity.
4. When someone edits issue in Github it won't get edited in or system
5. When someone marks complete, etc. Make proper two way sync and get activities from Github.
