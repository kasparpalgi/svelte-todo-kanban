Task 023 was completed but I can see only my own activity. Maybe Hasura rights issue maybe something else.

Also, log more and display more. We already for example store when priority changed then old and new etc. See what is logged right now and see what else could be logged. Document it here. Then implement.

When we display more then we also need to make the activity log modal wider and make the activity log click not to take asap to the card but slide open to read the full activity and from there option to click to go to card.
