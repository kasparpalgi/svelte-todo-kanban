In routes folder I have /penon route that shows temperature, humidity etc. Works well everywhere except in my old Android 5.1.1 phone where in built in "Internet" browser and in downloaded "Chrome" browser it will first say it is unsafe but I can click advanced and then I can click proceed and the page opens. But the https is red and it will tell: Cargando... (not ,ounted). In my all other devices https works and I can see the graphs and temp etc. All good.
