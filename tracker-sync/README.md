# Tracker integration

## Authentication

User downloads the app with JWT token generated inside the app.

## Sync

Tracker creates records to local text files and when from settings the records created by the tracker are periodically (every 10min or similar?) synced to the database. By now it will be the single central database hosted by us but user can deploy own database in own server (in future) to keep everything private.
