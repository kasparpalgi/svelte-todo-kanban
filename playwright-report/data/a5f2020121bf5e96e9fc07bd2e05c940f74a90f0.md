- generic [ref=e4]:
  - img "Try something different" [ref=e5]
  - paragraph [ref=e6]: Just a casual 404 aka. this exact URL doesn't exist (anymore)! OR maybe we have error in this super error prone app? 🤪🤪🤪
  - button "Try to go here" [ref=e7] [cursor=pointer]:
    - text: Try to go here
    - img
  - paragraph [ref=e8]: (if this also doesn't work then the whole app is SO broken that the all the developers around the world will be laughing)
