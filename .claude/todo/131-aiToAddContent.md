See how I use voice input and AI to correct my new todo item title. Make it also possible to add content with voice/AI.
Also, for notes - both title and content.

If there's pre-existing content then provide to AI also the existing content to make more sense with proper context and prompt. Eg. shortly: here's user's voice input to correct: ****, here's the rest of the card content above user input: ****, here's the rent of the user card content below the user input: ****. Title of the card: ****. Feel free to add very short suggestion below the user input, too in content.
