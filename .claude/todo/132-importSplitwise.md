See task 129 where Splitwise-like functionality was created. Now see in '_notes' folder how expenses exported from Splitwise look like in file 'import.csv' where there are just 2 users so it is clear that -X€ is me and the +X€ the other user on the board. Then see 'import2.csv' where there are expenses split between more than 2 users so we need to ask the names of the users behind these expenses. 

Add button to expenses page 'Import from Splitwise' small somewhere. Then let the user to select file from the device to import.
