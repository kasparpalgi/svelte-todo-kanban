I can see the graphs but there are some changes needed:

1. On the X and Y axis we shall also see th legend - at the moment no idea what is the temp or humidity. Also, when mouseover the graph line then display that specific period's eg. 13:15 - 19.2°C

2. Display times not in Greenwitch mean time but in Gran Canaria summer or winter time depending what time currently is.

3. Date format instead 2/8/2026 - Lunes, 2 de Febrero'26 (some Spanish format as the whole this page shall be in Spanish)
