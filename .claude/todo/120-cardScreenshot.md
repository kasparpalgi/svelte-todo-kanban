When pasting a card in eg. Facebook messenger then instead of logo display the first image attached if there is any image attached otherwise the screenshot of the modal where the card is (no surrounding). Height as much as is needed so it is ideal size for og image. 

If board link is pasted then screenshot of the board.

Not sure but to have the right aspect ratio, we need to check also the size of the screen I think, too to calculate the wideness in pixels of the card modal?
