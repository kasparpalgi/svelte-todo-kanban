When I login with Google Oauth and I have enabled Google Drive API at Google Cloud console then I guess you can make a new route [lang]/invoice/import that I can choose a Google Drive folder there to import invoices PDFs and then get from all invoices in that folder:

Makse saaja	
Arve number
Arve kuupäev
Arve summa	
Summa ilma km-ta (if VAT company)	

There are also payment slips from bank from  where you read:
Tasumise kuupäev

With this extracted data from PDFs create a new spreadsheet in Drive.
