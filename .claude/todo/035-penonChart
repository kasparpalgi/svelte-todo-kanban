On temperature graph on the vertical axis I can see 28, 26, 24, 22, 20 etc numbers and then dotted white lines going 1/3 of the left side of the screen. Make them go all the way to the right that red dotted lines go on temperature on 25, 20 and 19 only. Remove tose red ones.

On humidity graph below no red ones so just make also the white lines go all the way to the right.
