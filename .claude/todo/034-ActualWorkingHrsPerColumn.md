At the bottom of each Kanban column there's total of estimated working hours: min, max and avg. Now add there also total of actual hours spent. If actual hours spent npt written then use average (avg) of the estimated instead and if one or more card does't have either min/max to calculate average nor actual hours stated then have a red ! for example of icon of ! or some kind of other warning icon.
