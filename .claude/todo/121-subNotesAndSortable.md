On the bottom right of each note add a + icon and when you mouseover it it should say "Add note under here" in all three languages. When clicked new subnote shall be added under that note.

On the top left of each note @file src/lib/components/notes/NotesList.svelte is at the moment one small icon - replace it with chevron if note has subnotes and then with nice animation display subnotes. Also can close subnotes.

Also, see how at kanban board Neodrag is used to sort cards and make it possible to drag the notes to change sort order and put under other parent if subnotes.
