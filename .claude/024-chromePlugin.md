Break each task into even smaller tasks and first create a plan in this same file. Then take small tasks one by one.

Create Chrome plugin to add content to your board's notes.

1. Connect to your account
2. Click on plugin icon will open small nice looking content to pick the board. Last selected board by default selected.
3. Comment input area that is optional
4. AI summarise checkbox (see how AI is already integrated for voice AI input)
5. When "add button clicked" then:
 - Meta Title -> note title
 - Content - meta content or if AI summarise checked then that
 - Link to the URL clickable below meta content 
 - Cover image thumbnail from OG data or if that missing then from where? Let AI pick from code?
