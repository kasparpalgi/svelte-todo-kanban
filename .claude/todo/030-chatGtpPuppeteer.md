When user loggs in then is it possible somehow from user's IP start the Puppeteer extra and like human open a (headless but doesn't have to be) browser to login to ChatGTP? The idea is not to use API programmatically but use programmatically free of charge user's chatGTP. 

Or Chromium needs to be installed? It is PWA or that is not enough and must make Electron desktop app then?

Login must be email/password or Google Oauth can also be used?
